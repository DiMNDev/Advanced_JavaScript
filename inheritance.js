//Different types of inheritance

/*
Classical Inheritance - Where we create a class/blueprint
of what our object should be but is just a plan,
then we make an instance that it is built FROM the 
class/blueprint. You can't live inside a house design 
but you can live in a house.

Prototypal Inheritance - There isn't a design/blueprint
for the house, just a house. We can then build another 
house based on the original house.
    - Prototypal pattern
    - Pseudo-Classical pattern
